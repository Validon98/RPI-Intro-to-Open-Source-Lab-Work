Gitstats does not work for me for some strange reason, so I could not include the results from it. I would imagine the results would be similar, but I can't get it to work, so I can't compare them on my own. If one of my table members (I was part of table 5) got it to work, then they should be able to show the results. Sadly I can't.

I also tried to run ffmpeg to convert the gource files to mp4 videos, but all I get is a tilted over, greyscale version, and I'm not sure why this is the way it is, so not even that is working properly. I don't know what to show now given ffmpeg doesn't want to work. I can show that gource works, though, because it does.

##Part 2

The code and test code are in the labs folder, alongside this report. It took a lot of testing, but each of the tags works properly, at least for a base unit case. Due to time constraints additional tests weren't made, but at the least the header tags should work properly in all cases.
